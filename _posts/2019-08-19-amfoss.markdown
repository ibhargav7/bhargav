#TASKS DONE

**Before Lab Session**:

 * *Task 0* :
  Installed ubuntu using USB flash drive.
  *******
* *Task 2* :
 Solved all hacker rank and code force problems using python. At first  I wasn't familiar with any programming. Learnt python from CS50 videos and some functions from other websites
* *Task 8* :
 Done by using PIL and Pytesseract packages. Tessseract is an optical  character recognition engine which reads the text in the given image. Using this it wasn't that difficult to complete the task.

 *Task 9*:
 done the task by using jekyll  a static website generator. Didn't change the theme because I feel like default theme was looking good.


  **During lab sessions** :

* *Task 6* :
  Done by referring Dghubble/go- repository in github. Golang quiet difficult to learn. Just learnt some basic syntax in go. logged into  the twitter developer account and after two days got the token key and secret. We can get the required result just by using twitter id.

* *Task 7* :
  At first I don't have an idea how to do this task later I came  to  came to  know about the regex and learnt the syntax and watched some tutorials of it and did the task

  **BLOCKERS** :

  Cannot extract  the required data from the parsed data and cannot give thee correct class for the information required.
